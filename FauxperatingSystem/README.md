# FauxperatingSystem
A faux operating system running on top of windows.   
Includes:  
* Assembler
* Disassembler
* Assembly Language
* Custom compiled high level language
* File system
* Command line

Made over the course of a couple of hours over a few days.  

**Etymology**  
It's a portmanteau of "faux" and "operating system". I know, I'm a genius.

TODO:  
* Disassembler
* File System
* Custom high level language
* String escape codes
* Assembly: string of length x
* Command Line
* Fix max variable count
